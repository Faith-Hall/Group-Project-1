Title: Impact of Energy Consumption on Life Expectancy
Contributors:  Cassia Yoon, Thomas Keene, Kyle Dalton, Faith Hall
Project Description/Outline: 
The aim of our project is to determine if there is a correlation between energy availability and life expectancy. We will examine consumption of energy per capita per type of energy source around the world and compare it to life expectancy data around the world. The overall goal of these analyses will be to provide an overall picture of the energy consumption of the countries with the longest and shortest life expectancies. We will also explore possible other factors that may play into this correlation such as poverty, and air quality.

# need to update
Research Questions to Answer: 
Do countries that rely heavily on fossil fuels have shorter life expectancies than countries that rely on renewable fuels?
Does higher energy consumption correlate with longer life expectancy?
How does the use of renewable energy impact life expectancy?
